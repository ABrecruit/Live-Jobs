What are we offering?

We have seriously nice offices in Soho, with approximately one gazillion nice restaurants, coffee shops, bars and pubs on our doorstep (we’ve tried counting them, but it is impossible). And unlike in Tech City, the internet actually works. We do not skimp on hardware or software and you can have whatever equipment and tools you need to do your job properly.

We provide fresh fruit, the odd lunch/night out and there are various nerf guns around the office to keep the PHP devs under control. We have bean bags and a pool table (with an active inter-office league). 

We offer competitive salaries and generous bonuses based on performance as well as private health insurance and pensions.
