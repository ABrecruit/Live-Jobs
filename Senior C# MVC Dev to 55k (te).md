Senior Web Developer

About the role
We write software that allows hundreds of thousands of gay men to find, connect and interact with each other. We are the biggest network of our kind with over 600,000 registered members and at peak times of the day we have around 50,000 concurrent members online, which brings its own unique set of challenges.

We are a small, fun-loving, friendly, supportive, highly productive, quality and results-oriented team seeking exceptional developers who are truly passionate about technology and the software development process and currently working on a complete redesign of our flagship product (and migrating from ASP.NET Web Forms to ASP.NET MVC and AngularJS) and you’ll be responsible for leading the Web UI effort, helping to set the coding standards and maintaining the high standards of quality our customers have come to expect from us. You’ll do this by caring about the quality of your work, being meticulous when testing your own work before sending it for peer review and you’ll be firm but fair when reviewing the work of others in the team. Like all of us, you’ll strive for self-improvement and will be provided with access to Pluralsight’s full library of online training videos as well as afforded time to view them.

Initially your time will be spent creating new responsive interfaces for existing screens, this will be greenfield code as we migrate from Web Forms to ASP.NET MVC. We also have some exciting new features scheduled for development soon after the redesign process is complete and another large and challenging project in the very near future.

What’s it like to work in the development team?

•	Like you, we take pride in shipping high quality software and we understand that quality takes time.
•	The development team has a strong emphasis on collaboration, problem solving and getting things right, yet we’re supportive when things go wrong.
•	We all enjoy our jobs and care very deeply about growing as individuals, as a team and as a business. 
•	The management team is very approachable and works very closely with the developers and we are fortunate to have the very unique opportunity of guiding the business on technological solutions and systems we implement to satisfy 	the business objectives.
•	There’s a fun, relaxed atmosphere at our great office in Islington, London located between Angel and Old Street with plenty of space, casual environment, comfy chairs, complimentary soft drinks, coffee, tea and fruit. There’s no 	waiting around impatiently for cranky old hardware either – we have powerful development machines with SSD hard drives and dual monitors.
•	We follow an Agile/SCRUM-based iterative development process and short delivery iterations.
•	We are dedicated to keeping up with the latest technologies, practices, patterns and tools related to software development. We take time out to share our knowledge with one another and improve both our skills and our development 	environment.
•	We are open to new technology and often experiment with, and integrate new tools into our environment. Some of the tools and technologies we're currently using are: Objective C, Java,  ASP.NET MVC 4/5 (C#), ReSharper, GitHub, SQL 	Server, MySQL, MongoDB, Memcached, RESTful web services, jQuery, AngularJS, Less, NUnit, Moq, Responsive web design and AWS cloud services and hosting. 
•	We have an automated build process that allows us to deploy changes to all of our testing environments and prepare live builds with one click. The automated build server also builds the solution after every code change and alerts 	us when the build fails.
•	You’ll have the satisfaction you get from knowing that your work is being appreciated by hundreds of thousands of users and you will also learn creative ways to solve problems related to scaling to accommodate such a large user 	base on a system where there is a high and increasing amount of online interaction.
